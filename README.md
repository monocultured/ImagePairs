# ImagePairs
Show two images from one directory, swap either out, save the combo

The imagined use case is for someone who needs to try out different image combinations and quickly find interesting solutions â€“ think image editors, designers, etc.

I wrote up the original problem on Metafilter: https://ask.metafilter.com/331637/This-goes-well-with-that and user https://github.com/tomgp developed a solution using Electron and node.js, but I've long since broken all dependencies, so decided to try to recreate the app in Python using Perplexity.ai

I take no responsibility for this working for you in any shape or form.

Keyboard shortcuts:

j = swap out left image
l = swap out right image
k = swap both images
s = save image combination as image file on desktop, named as "file1_file2"

Don't forget to swap out folder_path = 'images/' to your own image directory
