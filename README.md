# ImagePairs
Show two images from one directory, swap either out, save the combo

The imagined use case is for someone who needs to try out different image combinations and quickly find interesting solutions â€“ think image editors, designers, etc.

I wrote up the original problem on Metafilter: https://ask.metafilter.com/331637/This-goes-well-with-that and user https://github.com/tomgp developed a solution using Electron and node.js, but I've long since lost the packages, so decided to try to recreate the app myself in Python using Perplexity.ai

I take no responsibility for this working for you in any shape or form.
