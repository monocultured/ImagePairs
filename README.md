# ImagePairs
Show two images from one directory, swap either out, save the combo

The use if for someone who needs to try out different image combinations to quickly find interesting solutions. 

I wrote up the original problem on Metafilter: https://ask.metafilter.com/331637/This-goes-well-with-that
User https://github.com/tomgp developed a solution using Electron and node.js, but I've long since lost the packages, so decided to try to recreate the app myself in Python using Perplexity.ai

I take no responsibility for this working for you or any consequences
